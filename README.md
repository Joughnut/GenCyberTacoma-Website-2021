# GenCyberTacoma-Website-2021
(last updated: March 29)
Repository containing website made as part of GenCyber Tacoma internship. Last updated March 2021, when I successfully completed the internship.

Purpose of the website is to showcase and advertise GenCyber Tacoma, a free, one-week summer camp aimed to promote cybersecurity education among middle
to high school aged students. As the internship is still active for other students at the time of writing, wanted to upload my version in case it experienced
modifications once I left.

Contains home, camp info, FAQ, and application page. Application page originally contained simple PHP script to validate and sanitize user input.
Form data would then be sent to gencyber email. However, PHP script has been removed for security reasons since the website is still active to advertise 2021 camp.
Since websites are made yearly for this internship, once 2021 website goes down, PHP script will be uploaded.
