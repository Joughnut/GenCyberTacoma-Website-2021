# GenCyberTacoma-Website-2021
Repository containing website made for GenCyber Tacoma internship. Last updated March 2021, when I successfully completed the internship.

Files containing website to showcase and advertise GenCyber Tacoma, a free, one-week summer camp aimed to promote cybersecurity education among middle
to high school aged students. Last Updated March 2021, when my internship ended.

Contains home, camp info, FAQ, and application page. Application page originally contained simple PHP script to validate and sanitize user input.
Form data would then be sent to gencyber email. However, PHP script has been removed for security reasons since the website is still active to advertise 2021 camp.
Once 2021 website goes down, PHP script will be uploaded.
